# Alien-Invasion

This was a side project that I took up while learning python. I used pygame in order to build a version of the classic arcade game alien invasion. The levels get progressively harder as the game goes on and I will be adding features to track scores later on.

You can start the game by clicking the play button and will move the ship with the arrow keys. You can fire bullets with the space bar and the game will get progressively harder as you clear the screen of aliens. Enjoy!
